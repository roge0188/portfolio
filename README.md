# portfolio
This is my web porfolio that will be displaying my assignments for level 1 and 2 in the algonquin college Imd ptogram and I will be also displaying my brand name "design wrld" and my logo along with a biography of myself. My process started off slow but good because I decided to start my portfolio ahead of time to give myself more time to work on it. It was difficult to use bootstrap and css for my `<nav>` but after trying and failing until I succeeded I was then able to successfully get my to `<nav>`work. I learned that using bootstrap is less complicated than it seems and all that needs to be done is to try again and again until the answer is found.

This is where you can find the bootstrap link I used for my web portfolio:
